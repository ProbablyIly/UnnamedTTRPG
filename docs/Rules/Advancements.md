As the story progresses, your character will develop both narratively and mechanically. The former is the responsibility of you as a player, and your GM. The latter is handled by the XP system.

XP is given out by the GM to the entire party at the end of each session, the amount is up to the GMs discretion and is usually decided by narrative progression. XP is a currency, which can be used to upgrade and develop your character mechanically.
