There are 3 types of skills, Single Skills, Split Skills and Sequential Skills. You unlock new skills by gaining levels, and you can choose which slot to equip your skill at. A skill can be activated when rolling dice equal to the match in its slot.

Single Skills

Pair

Three of a Kind
  

Split Skills

Two Pair

Full House
  

Sequential Skills

Straight: While rolling a straight means failure (unless combined with a pair or similar), it activates a sequential ability, which are usually very powerful.
