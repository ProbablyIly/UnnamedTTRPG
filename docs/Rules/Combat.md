When making an attack, you first need to determine if it connects, you do this by comparing the number of your matches to the opponent’s Reflexes, if it is equal or higher, you hit.

On a hit, your attack deals a Wound, its severity equal to the roll’s potency. Wounds are first and foremost narrative, and can be anything you agree upon with your GM. A broken arm, dislocated shoulder, severe bleeding. The only requirement is that it matches your attack’s narrative description, and the roll’s severity.

Wounds impact your abilities in and out of combat, if at any point your wound may realistically influence the outcome of a roll or check, subtract its severity from the dice pool. This can come into effect in many ways, and can be negotiated with your GM, you may argue a dislocated shoulder would not impair your character’s ability to wield a shortsword as you were raised ambidextrous. Or perhaps you may argue to forgo a fresh wound’s negatives moments after its inception due to the high adrenaline allowing you to keep fighting.

Wounds do not automatically heal, and must be treated to have them heal, this may take time, and may require certain narrative beats.

When the sum of your wounds’ severity surpasses your Wound Capacity, if not immediately treated, you die!
