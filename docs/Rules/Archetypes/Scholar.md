## Archetype Skills
### Blueprints
When making a roll, you can deposit any one of the dice, by excluding it from the current roll, and keeping it as a Blueprint Die. You can later use it in subsequent rolls by withdrawing it from your sheet. You can store up to 3 Blueprint Dice at any given moment.
### Improvised Schematics (depracated)
When crafting items and gadgets, you may substitute materials which you are missing (at the GMs discretion) with a Blueprint Die of a value equal to the item’s value.
### Delayed Epiphany
Once your Blueprint Dice are full, and after making a roll, you may decide to store all of the dice in their current state, failing the roll as a result. At any later point you may add all of those dice to a different roll
