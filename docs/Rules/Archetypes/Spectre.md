## Archetype Skills
### Sneaky Sabotage
Upon any roll (besides your own) you may decide to steal one of their dice at the expense of ignoring all dice of the stolen value in your next roll. You keep Stolen Dice on your sheet, and may only steal dice of values which you have not stolen. Upon a failed roll, lose all stolen dice. When you have gathered 6 Stolen Dice, you can add them to one of your rolls.
### Sharing is Caring
You may add a Stolen Die of your choice to a roll that is not your own. If that roll fails, lose all Stolen Dice.
