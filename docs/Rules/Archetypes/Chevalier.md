### Archetype Skill: Successive Buildup

Place a Counter die in front of you set to 1. On a successful roll, increase its value by 1 (up to a max of 6). At any time, you can choose to expend it, causing all dice of that value to double their matches (i.e: If expended while the counter was set to 3, a pair of 3 would instead count as a four of a kind, or a single 3 would count as a pair). Once expended, replace it with a new die.

### Archetype Skill: Perfected Strike

You can expend your Counter die, and include it in your current roll.
