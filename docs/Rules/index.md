This article will be a very brief explanation on how the game is played, with each of its respective child articles being a granular explanation of the respective segment.

## What is a TTRPG?
A TTRPG, also known as a tabletop roleplaying game is a social and collaborative storytelling game, where one person, known as the Game Master (GM) leads a story, with a group of players, acting as the main cast of the story.
### Why is this TTRPG different?
This TTRPG is built to specifically accommodate our own setting while addressing many issues and nitpicks we have with TTRPGs both as players and GMs. Our primary innovation is the dice system, which you will be explained shortly.
 
But most importantly of all, play this game in your own way, these rules are a suggestions, they are a foundation to build upon, rules are meant to be broken, and if you think something may be cooler differently, do it your way!
## [[Traits]]
### What are traits?
Traits are the foundation of your character, they reflect your physical and mental capabilities. The traits are:

**Physique** - Your stature, your strength.
**Instinct** - Your reflexes, your senses.
**Resilience** - Your endurance, your fortitude.
**Ingenuity** - Your creativity, your inventiveness. 
**Presence** - Your charisma, your social wit.

The higher a trait, the better you are at it, the minimum a trait can go is 2.
### Choosing Traits
To determine your trait, you start with 12 points and you can choose what value to buy per trait according to the following table:

| Point Cost | Trait |
| ---------- | ----- |
| 0 points   | 2     |
| 1 point    | 3     |
| 2 points   | 4     |
| 4 points   | 5     |
| 6 points   | 6     |
| 8 points   | 7     |

## [[Dice]]
Dice rolls are a way to resolve uncertainties and conflict, whenever an action that requires more than a little effort, the GM may call for a dice roll, at which point you roll an amount of dice, dictated by your character sheet (will be expanded upon shortly) to determine the degree of success.

Rolling involves a pool of D6s (sixth sided dice) and the success is determined by the number of matching numbers, the following table illustrates possible combinations:

| Combination         | Degree of Success                 | Example           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| No matches          | Failure                           | 1, 5, 3           |
| Two matching dice   | Partial success                   | 2, 2, 5           |
| Three matching dice | Minor success                     | 5, 5, 5.          |
| Four matching dice  | Major success                     | 6, 6, 6, 6        |
| Five matching dice  | Critical success                  | 3, 3, 3, 3, 3     |
| Two Pair            | Two Partial Successes             | 1, 1, 4, 4        |
| Full House          | One Minor and one Partial Success | 2, 2, 2, 3, 3     |
