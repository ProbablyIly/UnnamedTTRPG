This article will be a very brief explanation on how the game is played, with each of its respective child articles being a granular explanation of the respective segment.
## What is a TTRPG?
A TTRPG, also known as a tabletop roleplaying game is a social and collaborative storytelling game, where one person, known as the Game Master (GM) leads a story, with a group of players, acting as the main cast of the story.
### Why is this TTRPG different?
This TTRPG is built to specifically accommodate our own setting while addressing many issues and nitpicks we have with TTRPGs both as players and GMs. Our primary innovation is the dice system, which you will be explained shortly.
 
But most importantly of all, play this game in your own way, these rules are a suggestions, they are a foundation to build upon, rules are meant to be broken, and if you think something may be cooler differently, do it your way!
## [[Traits]]
### What are traits?
Traits are the foundation of your character, they reflect your physical and mental capabilities. The traits are:

**Physique** - Your stature, your strength.
**Instinct** - Your reflexes, your senses.
**Resilience** - Your endurance, your fortitude.
**Ingenuity** - Your creativity, your inventiveness. 
**Presence** - Your charisma, your social wit.

The higher a trait, the better you are at it, the minimum a trait can go is 2.
### Choosing Traits
To determine your trait, you start with 12 points and you can choose what value to buy per trait according to the following table:

| Point Cost | Trait |
| ---------- | ----- |
| 0 points   | 2     |
| 1 point    | 3     |
| 2 points   | 4     |
| 4 points   | 5     |
| 6 points   | 6     |
| 8 points   | 7     |
### What are traits used for?
Traits are used to decide how many dice you roll, an amount of sixth sided dice equal to the value of your trait. How rolls are constructed and resolved will be explained below.
## [[Disciplines]]
Disciplines are certain areas of expertise which your character excels at, they are represented numerically from 0 to 3. Whenever you make a roll that uses a particular discipline, it grants you a number of rerolls equal to your rank in it.
## [[Dice]]
### What are dice rolls?
Dice rolls are a way to resolve uncertainties and conflict, whenever an action that requires more than a little effort, the GM may call for a dice roll, at which point you roll an amount of dice, dictated by your character sheet to determine the degree of success.
### Resolving a roll
Rolling involves a pool of D6s (sixth sided dice) and the success is determined by the number of matching numbers, the following table illustrates possible combinations:

| Combination         | Degree of Success                 | Example           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| No matches          | Failure                           | 1, 5, 3           |
| Two matching dice   | Partial success                   | 2, 2, 5           |
| Three matching dice | Minor success                     | 5, 5, 5.          |
| Four matching dice  | Major success                     | 6, 6, 6, 6        |
| Five matching dice  | Critical success                  | 3, 3, 3, 3, 3     |
| Two Pair            | Two Partial Successes             | 1, 1, 4, 4        |
| Full House          | One Minor and one Partial Success | 2, 2, 2, 3, 3     |
| Straight            | Failure                           | 1, 2, 3 (or more) |
### How do I determine my roll?
Each dice roll is associated with a specific Trait and Discipline, for example: Presence (Trait) and Grit (Discipline), you gather a number of dice equal to your Presence (Trait) and roll them. The value of your Grit (Discipline) determines how many times you can reroll your dice.
### How do I know what Trait and Discipline to use?
When asked to roll by your GM, you will generally be prompted with the Trait and Discipline, but, these are negotiable! If you think your character could realistically accomplish the action using a different Trait and Discipline, provided you explain your reasoning to your GM and they agree, you may roll with those values instead.
## [[Skills]]
Skills are useful and powerful abilities which represent your prowess and skillset. There are Three types of skills: **Archetype Skills** **Dice Skills** and **Active Skills**. Each character, according to its archetype, has a number of slots to which you can equip an appropriate skill.
### Archetype Skills
Archetype Skills are gained through one's archetype and are always equipped, they tend to be defining gameplay concepts which change the way in which dice are interacted with according to your archetype.
### Dice Skills
Dice Skills are skills which are activated based on dice rolls, and once its trigger conditions have been fulfilled.

There are three types of Dice Skills:  **Single Skills**, **Split Skills** and **Sequential Skills**. Each skill can only be equipped into their respective type's slot.
#### Single Skills
Single Skills are activated when a single success has been achieved (by rolling a Pair or higher). They allow you to mess with dice results and affect the outcome of your action.
#### Split Skills
Split Skills are activated when two split success have been achieved (by rolling a Two Pair, Full House, or higher), they generally involve 
#### Sequential Skills
Sequential Skills are activated when a sequence has been achieved (such as a Straight), while not inherent (in the case a Straight is combined with another combo), most Straight rolls result in a failure, and as such, Sequential Skills are generally related to misdirection, detours and chaining other actions. 
### Active Skills
Active Skills are skills which you must manually activate to function, most usually they have a limited number of uses which resets according to their cond
