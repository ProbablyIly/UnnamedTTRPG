## The Electromagnetic Constant
The electromagnetic constant is the ratio of 

## Electromagnetic Generator RPM to Electricity Formula
$$J=RPM \times m \times \eta$$
Where:
J is the Electrical output of the Generator
RPM is the Rotations Per Minute
m is the the Magnetic Force of the block surrounding the Generator Coil
η is the Electromagnetic Constant, which is equal to 45/128 or rounded as 0.35 (2 sf)

## Electromagnetic Generator RPM to Stress Formula
$$SU=36RPM\times m$$
Where:
SU is the Stress Units required to upkeep the Generator
RPM is the Rotations Per Minute
m is the the Magnetic Force of the block surrounding the Generator Coil
